      <h3>Define Internet backbone in your own words</h3>
      <p>Internet backbone is the structure of the main routes for data transportation</p>
      <h3>What is the difference between clients and servers on the internet?</h3>
      <p>A client is a device that requests information from other devices, known as servers.</p>
      <p>A server is a powerful device that responds to the requests from clients</p>
      <h3>Draw or describe how servers, routers, switches, work stations, and other hardware components are part of the internet.</h3>
      <ul id='components'>
        <li>Client: A client is a device that sends requests information from other devices</li>
        <img src="https://uxwing.com/wp-content/themes/uxwing/download/computers-mobile-hardware/client-server-color-icon.png" alt="an image of the symbol used for clients in networking diagrams" id='components'>
        <li>Server: A server is a powerful device that provides the information requested by clients</li>
        <li>Router: A router is a device that forwards data packets between networks</li>
        <li>Switch: A switch forwards data packets between devices, but it does it directly instead of doing it over the network</li>
        <li>Work Station: </li>
              </ul>    
      <h3>Describe the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) model of networking, in general terms, outlining how this protocol provides the data transfer mechanism required to establish client/server relationships.</h3>
      <p>The TCP/IP model is a transfer protocol similar to the OSI protocol, but it uses less layers, allowing for it to be simpler and more efficient. When sending data using the TCP/IP model, it splits the data up into packets at the sender's end, then recombines it at the receiving end.
      It allows for fast and reliable transfer of information between clients and servers.</p>
      <h3>List at least three examples of internet services that rely on client/server relationships.</h3>
      <p>Email, web browsing, and file transfers</p>
      <h3>What is hypertext?</h3>
      <p>Hypertext is text with hyperlinks to other sources</p>
      <h3>How is “the web” related to the internet?</h3>
      <p>"The Web" is all the pages that are available to see, the internet is the network of connected computers in which the web is hosted</p>
      <h3>Explain how the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used to facilitate client/server interaction.</h3>
      <p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) </p>
      <h3>What is HTTP and how is it different from HTTPS?</h3>
      <p>HTTP is the underlying technology behind network communication. HTTPS is a more secure version of HTTP</p>
      <h3>Describe and illustrate the development of the Web in general terms using the Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 generational paradigms.</h3>
      <p></p>
      <h3>Compare and contrast the Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 stages of development.</h3>
      <table id=web-info>
        <tr>
          <th>Web 1.0</th>
          <th>Web 2.0</th>
          <th>Web 3.0</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Web 1.0 is the first version of the web, it has been long replaced </td> 
          <td>Web 2.0 is the second iteration of the program, it has been replaced by Web 3.0 and has become obsolete. Its primary functions are reading and writing programs</td>
          <td>Web 3.0 is the version used from 2006 to the present day. It is the most complex version, allowing users to read, write, and execute programs.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>All three versions rely on the internet to perform tasks, they all have some form of the "read" function, and they all </p>
      <h3>Describe the role markup languages play in the Web.</h3>
      <p>Markup languages are the building blocks of the Web</p>
      <h3>Compare and contrast markup and scripting languages</h3>
      <p>Scripting languages are usually slower than markup languages because they need to convert the code. While they are slower, they also provide more functionality by allowing complex code to be added. Markup languages are just the basic structure of what a webpage should look like.</p>
      <h3>Explain the relationship between Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML), Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language (DHTML), and markdown (MD).</h3>
      <p>All of the languages listed are forms of markup languages</p>
      <ul>
       <li>SGML: </li>
       <li>XML: </li>
       <li>HTML: </li>
       <li>XHTML: </li>
       <li>DHTML: </li>
       <li>MD: </li>
       
      </ul>
      <h3>List some of your own interests, values, beliefs, resources, prior learning and experiences.</h3>
      <p>Some of my interests are building mechanical systems, often with lego. I also enjoy the programming behind games and softwares. I have very little prior experience with these subjects, but am currently taking courses to aid me with this</p>
      <h3>Describe how CSE1210 may connect to your future occupational choices.</h3>
      <p>This course could help with designing websites or programming games for a company or game studio. </p>
